PROOFS, Proff.Tom Leighton
1. Proposition

A proposition is just a sentence that can be true or false.

Example:

“Dogs bark.” → true

“1 + 1 = 3.” → false

That’s all.

✅ 2. NOT

NOT means no or opposite.

If something is true,
NOT makes it false.

✅ 3. AND

AND means both things must happen.

Example:
“You eat AND you drink.”
→ You must do both.

✅ 4. OR

OR means any one is enough.

Example:
“You can have tea OR coffee.”
→ You can take tea,
→ or coffee,
→ or even both.

✅ 5. IMPLIES (If → then)

This means:

If something happens, then another thing must happen.

Example:
“If it rains, then the road gets wet.”

It is wrong only when:

It rains

but the road does NOT get wet

Only that case is false.

Everything else → true.

✅ 6. IFF (if and only if)

This means:
Both things are the same.

Both true → OK
Both false → OK
Different → NOT OK

✅ 7. For all (∀)

Means everybody, everything.

Example:
“For all numbers, x + 0 = x.”

✅ 8. There exists (∃)

Means at least one.

Example:
“There exists a number that is 5.”
→ Yes, the number 5.

🎯 FINAL TINY SUMMARY (Just 5 lines)

Proposition = true/false sentence

1. NOT (¬P)

This table shows the opposite.

P	NOT P
T (true)	F (false)
F (false)	T (true)

👉 Whatever P is, NOT P is the opposite.

✅ 2. AND (P ∧ Q)

IFF = same truth value
✅ 1. Contrapositive, Converse, Inverse

The video explains these:

1) Contrapositive

P → Q
same as
¬Q → ¬P
(always equivalent)

2) Converse

Q → P
(not equivalent)

3) Inverse

¬P → ¬Q
(also not equivalent)

✅ 2. Logical Equivalence

Two statements are equivalent when they always have the same truth values.

Example:
P → Q
is equivalent to
¬P OR Q

✅ 3. Using Logical Equivalence to Simplify

Example from video:
(P OR (NOT P AND Q))
simplifies to
(P OR Q)

They show this using a truth table.

✅ 4. Predicates

A predicate is like a function that gives true or false depending on input.

Example:
P(n): “n is a perfect square”

✅ 5. Quantifiers

Two types:

Universal (∀)

“For all”

Existential (∃)

“There exists”

They also show symbols like:
∀x ∈ ℕ : P(x)

✅ 6. Combining Quantifiers

Example from the video:
Goldbach’s conjecture
∀n (exists p, q such that p + q = n)

They show how changing order changes the meaning.

✅ 7. Negating Quantifiers

The video teaches:

¬(∀x P(x)) = ∃x ¬P(x)
¬(∃x P(x)) = ∀x ¬P(x)

Very important.

✅ 8. Validity & Satisfiability

They also explain:

Valid

Always true no matter what P, Q, R are.

Satisfiable

True for at least one combination.
1. First, the key idea of logic (very important)

In mathematical logic, a statement is judged only by whether it is violated, not by whether it sounds natural in English.

👉 “P implies Q” is considered FALSE only in one situation:

P is true

Q is false

In every other case, it is considered TRUE.

That single idea explains the whole table.

2. The truth table again (with meaning)
P	Q	P → Q	Meaning
T	T	T	Promise kept
T	F	F	Promise broken ❌
F	T	T	No promise made
F	F	T	No promise made
3. Why only (T → F) is false

Think of P → Q as a promise:

“If P happens, then Q will happen.”

Case by case:
(1) P = T, Q = T

“If you study, you will pass.”
You studied and you passed.
✅ Promise kept → TRUE

(2) P = T, Q = F

“If you study, you will pass.”
You studied but failed.
❌ Promise broken → FALSE

👉 This is the only false case.

(3) P = F, Q = T

“If you study, you will pass.”
You didn’t study, but still passed.
🤷 No rule was violated → TRUE

(4) P = F, Q = F

“If you study, you will pass.”
You didn’t study and didn’t pass.
🤷 Still no violation → TRUE

4. Now your confusing examples make sense
Example 1

“If pigs can fly, then you can understand the Chebyshev bound.”

P = “Pigs can fly” → False

Q = “You understand Chebyshev bound” → maybe False

So we are in F → F, which is TRUE in logic.

👉 This does NOT mean the Chebyshev bound is incomprehensible.
It only means the statement was not violated.

Example 2

“If you can solve any problem we come up with, then you get an A.”

Let:

P = “You can solve all problems”

Q = “You get an A”

If you solve some but not all problems:

P = False
So P → Q is automatically TRUE, regardless of Q.

👉 Logic alone does NOT guarantee you an A.
👉 It only says no logical contradiction occurred.

This is why English promises ≠ logical implication.

5. Very important takeaway (exam gold)
Logical implication is NOT causation
Logical implication is NOT a real-life promise
Logical implication is about truth preservation

P → Q is false only when:

P is true and Q is false

That’s it.

6. Do you need to memorize the table?

❌ No
✅ Just remember this one sentence:

“An implication is false only when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false.”

Everything else follows.
Chapter 2 -
Proof by contradiction
What is Proof by Contradiction?

Proof by contradiction means:

To prove a statement is true, we temporarily assume it is false.
If that assumption leads to impossible or illogical result, then our assumption must be wrong.

Therefore the original statement is true.

Structure

We want to prove P is true

Assume P is false

From this assumption we get a contradiction (impossible result)

Therefore the assumption is wrong

So P must be true

Symbolically in logic:

If assuming ¬P leads to contradiction → P is true

2️⃣ Example 1: √2 is irrational

This is the classic example.

We want to prove:

√2 is irrational

(Irrational = cannot be written as a fraction)

Step 1 — Assume the opposite

Assume √2 is rational.

So it can be written as:

√2 = a/b

Where:

a and b are integers

fraction is simplified (no common factor)

Step 2 — Square both sides

√2 = a/b

Square both sides:

2 = a² / b²

Multiply both sides by b²:

2b² = a²

Step 3 — Observe something important

2b² = a²

So a² is even.

If a² is even → a must be even.

So let:

a = 2k

Step 4 — Substitute again

a = 2k

a² = 4k²

Put into equation:

2b² = 4k²

Divide by 2:

b² = 2k²

Now b² is also even → b is even.

Step 5 — Contradiction

We found:

a is even

b is even

That means a and b have common factor 2.

But earlier we assumed fraction a/b was simplified.

This is a contradiction.

Step 6 — Conclusion

Our assumption was wrong.

So:

√2 cannot be rational

Therefore:

√2 is irrational.

3️⃣ Second Example: Triangle Area 90 > 92

This example is usually used to show impossible assumption.

Suppose someone claims:

A triangle with integer sides has area greater than 90 but less than 92

We assume this is true.

Then using Heron's formula, we compute possible triangles.

A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}

After checking all integer side combinations:

No triangle produces an area between 90 and 92.

So our assumption leads to impossibility.

Therefore the statement is false.

This is another contradiction-style reasoning.

4️⃣ Why do Computer Science students study this?

Proof by contradiction is very important in CS.

1. Algorithm correctness

Example:

Prove that an algorithm must terminate.

Assume it never terminates → leads to contradiction.

2. Graph theory

Example:

Prove properties like

shortest path

minimum spanning tree

Many proofs use contradiction.

3. Complexity theory

Example:

Proofs in:

NP-completeness

undecidable problems

use contradiction.

4. Logic in programming

Contradiction reasoning appears in:

SAT solvers

automated theorem proving

type systems

5️⃣ Simple intuition

Think like a detective method:

Instead of proving directly, you say:

“Let me assume the opposite is true.”

Then you follow the consequences.

If the result becomes impossible, the assumption must be wrong.

6️⃣ Why you felt sleepy reading it

Very normal reason.

Your brain was trying to understand:

logical structure

algebra

number theory

all at once.

That is heavy cognitive load.

Even MIT students pause on this proof.

7️⃣ Quick memory trick

Remember this pattern:

Goal: prove P

Assume NOT P

→ derive impossible result

Therefore NOT P is false

So P is true


If you want, I can also show you the easiest contradiction proof in computer science:

There are infinitely many prime numbers

It is very beautiful and easier than √2 proof.

What do you mean algoriths terminate , not getting

Good question. I’ll explain very simply.

What does “algorithm terminates” mean?

An algorithm terminates means:

The program eventually stops and gives an answer.

It does not run forever.

Example 1 — Terminating algorithm

Suppose we write an algorithm to count from 1 to 5.

start
i = 1

while i ≤ 5
   print i
   i = i + 1

stop

Output:

1
2
3
4
5

After printing 5, the program stops.

So this algorithm terminates.

Example 2 — Non-terminating algorithm

Now look at this:

start
i = 1

while i ≥ 1
   print i

Here:

i is always ≥ 1

the condition never becomes false

So the program runs forever.

This algorithm does not terminate.

Why termination matters in Computer Science

If an algorithm never stops, it is useless.

Imagine:

login system that never finishes

banking transaction that never completes

program stuck in loop

So computer scientists prove algorithms terminate.

Where contradiction is used

Sometimes it is hard to prove directly.

So we use proof by contradiction.

Example logic:

Assume the algorithm does NOT terminate

Follow the steps mathematically

We reach an impossible situation

Therefore assumption is wrong

So the algorithm must terminate

Simple real-life example

Imagine stairs with 10 steps.

You start at step 10 and move down one step each time.

Algorithm:

while step > 0
   step = step - 1

Steps:

10
9
8
7
...
1
0

Eventually you reach 0.

You cannot go forever.

So the algorithm must terminate.

Why MIT teaches this in Discrete Math

Because algorithms are built on logic proofs:

contradiction

induction

logic rules

sets

These help prove:

algorithms stop

algorithms are correct

algorithms are optimal

This is the mathematical foundation of Computer Science.
# Why AI Outputs Are Sometimes Correct and Sometimes Wrong

While studying Machine Learning lectures from MIT OpenCourseWare, I noticed an interesting idea about how AI systems generate results.

## AI models work using probability

Large Language Models and image generators do not truly "know" facts. Instead, they predict outputs based on statistical patterns learned from large datasets.

Example:

Prompt:
"The capital of France is ___"

The model predicts:

Paris

This happens because the pattern appears frequently in training data.

## When AI guesses wrong

If the prompt requires missing information, the model may still produce an answer even when it should say "not enough information."

Example:

Triangle angles = 50°, 60°, 70°  
Question: What is the area?

The area cannot be determined from angles alone, but an AI might still generate a number because it is trained to produce an output.

## Image generation example

Prompt:
"A cat riding a bicycle in space"

The model combines patterns of:

- cats
- bicycles
- space

Sometimes the result looks realistic.

Sometimes the result contains distortions (extra limbs, unusual shapes).

## Why wrong results are useful in machine learning

Many machine learning systems improve through an iterative process:

1. Generate an initial guess
2. Measure the error
3. Adjust parameters
4. Repeat

This process helps models gradually improve performance.

In a way, learning systems (both humans and machines) often follow:

Guess → Error → Correction → Improvement
Learning AI by Experiment: From Proof by Contradiction to Diffusion Models

While studying MIT OCW discrete mathematics, I came across the concept of proof by contradiction. The idea is simple but powerful: assume something might be true, follow the logic, and if it leads to an impossible result, we reject the assumption and learn the correct truth.

For example, mathematicians prove that √2 is irrational by first assuming the opposite — that it can be written as a fraction p/q. When this assumption leads to a contradiction, we conclude that the assumption must be false.

Interestingly, I realized a similar idea while experimenting with AI image generation.

I generated two images of a cat riding a bicycle using an AI model. One image looked correct, while the other came out slightly distorted.

This helped me understand how diffusion-based image models such as Stable Diffusion actually learn.

These models generate images through an iterative process of prediction and correction. Early guesses may be imperfect, but each step adjusts the noise and improves the image toward a more probable result. In a way, the model explores possibilities — including wrong ones — before converging toward something realistic.

My small experiment made me appreciate how theoretical concepts from mathematics connect with modern machine learning. Even unexpected outputs can be valuable because they reveal where the model is uncertain.

This kind of experimental learning — combining theory, coding, and observation — is what makes studying computer science exciting.

Attached are the two generated images from my experiment.

Core statement (Induction Axiom)

P(0) is true

𝑃

Then:

👉

💥 What this REALLY means (step-by-step)

Let’s go slowly.

Step 1: Start point

You prove:

👉

So first domino falls.

Step 2: Chain rule

You prove:

👉 If one is true, next is true

So:

Step 3: What happens logically

Since:

𝑃

🟡 So what is he “trying to say” in your notes?

Your messy paragraph means:

Once the first case is true, and each step leads to the next,
then by repeating this reasoning again and again,
all values become true.

🔵 Why he says “reasonable axiom”

He wrote:

“Induction is really just an axiom”

This means:

👉 We accept it as a basic truth of natural numbers

Because:

Natural numbers are ordered: 0,1,2,3,...

There are no gaps

So if truth keeps passing forward → it covers all numbers

🔥 The DOMINO analogy (most important)

Imagine:

Infinite dominoes: 0,1,2,3,...

You prove:

1️⃣ First domino falls
2️⃣ Each domino knocks next

👉 Then ALL dominoes fall

🧠 What Induction Really Means

We do two things only:

Check first case (Base Case)

Assume true for

n+1

✅ Step 1: Base Case

Put

	​

❗ Your confusion here

You thought:

“How do we KNOW this is true?”

✔️ Answer:

We don’t know yet
👉 We are temporarily assuming it

This is allowed in induction.

🚀 Step 3: Prove for

We want to prove:

1

+
𝑛

1+2+3+⋯+n+(n+1)

(1+2+3+⋯+n)+(n+1)
❗ Your confusion here

“How did we replace the first part?”

✅ Explanation

We already assumed:

1

+
𝑛
=
𝑛
(
𝑛

1
)
2
1+2+⋯+n=

n(n+1)
	​


So we SUBSTITUTE it:

𝑛

1
)
2
+
(
𝑛
+
1
)
=
2
n(n+1)
	​

+(n+1)

👉 This is valid because of the induction hypothesis

🔧 Algebra Part (Your Main Confusion)

We now simplify:

𝑛
(
𝑛

(
𝑛

)
=
2
(
𝑛

)
2
(n+1)=

So:

🧠 Another Confusion You Had

“Where did (n+2) come from suddenly?”

We had:

(
𝑛

(

)
n(n+1)+2(n+1)

Factor (n+1):

=

(

=(n+1)(n+2)

👉 The +2 comes from combining n and 2

🎯 Final Step

We proved:

 Statement

“In any group of horses, all horses are of the same color.”

❌ This statement is false, but it is used to demonstrate a faulty proof by induction.

🧠 The Induction Proof (Wrong but instructive)
🔹 Base Case (n = 1)
A single horse → obviously one color
✔ True
🔹 Induction Hypothesis

Assume:

For n horses, all are of the same color.

🔹 Induction Step (n → n+1)

Take n+1 horses:

𝐻

,
𝐻

,
𝐻
3
,

𝐻

H
1
	​

,H
2
	​

,H
3
	​

,...,H
n
	​

,H
n+1
	​


Split into two groups:

Group A: 
𝐻
1
,
𝐻
2
,
.
.
.
,
𝐻
𝑛
H
1
	​

,H

	​

,...,H
n
	​

 → same color (by assumption)
Group B: 
𝐻
2
,
𝐻
3
,
.
.
.
,
𝐻
𝑛
+
1
H
2
	​

,H

	​

,...,H
n+1
	​

 → same color (by assumption)

👉 Overlap: 
𝐻
2
H
2
	​

 to 
𝐻
𝑛
H
n
	​


So:

Both groups share common horses
Hence, colors “connect”

👉 Conclusion: all 
𝑛

n+1 horses are same color

# Tromino Tiling (Clear Step-by-Step Explanation)

## 🧩 Problem

Given a board of size \(2^n \times 2^n\) with **one missing square**,  
fill the board using only **L-shaped trominoes (3 squares each)**.

---

## 💡 Core Idea

We solve this using **Divide and Conquer**.

---

## 🔢 Step-by-Step Explanation

### ✅ Step 1: Start with Missing Square

Example: 4×4 board with one missing square

```
⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜
⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜
⬜ ⬜ ❌ ⬜
⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Divide into 4 Quadrants

Split board into 4 equal parts:

```
Q1 | Q2
-------
Q3 | Q4
```

Only **one quadrant has the real missing square**.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Place ONE Center Tromino (MOST IMPORTANT)

👉 This is where confusion happens. Read carefully.

We place **exactly ONE L-shaped tromino at the center**.

### ❗ Rule:
- It must cover **3 squares near the center**
- It must NOT cover the quadrant that already has the missing square

---

### 🎯 Example:

If missing square is in **Q4**, then:

👉 Place tromino covering center squares of:
- Q1  
- Q2  
- Q3  

```
⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜
⬜ 🟩 🟩 ⬜
⬜ 🟩 ❌ ⬜
⬜ ⬜ ⬜ ⬜
```

🟩 = ONE tromino (3 connected squares)

---

### 🧠 What just happened?

Now:

- Q4 → already had 1 missing square  
- Q1, Q2, Q3 → now each ALSO has 1 missing square (created by tromino)

👉 So now ALL quadrants have exactly ONE missing square

---

### ✅ Step 4: Solve Recursively

Now solve each quadrant separately.

Each is smaller version of same problem.

---

## 📊 Formula

Total squares = \(4^n\)

One missing ⇒ \(4^n - 1\)

Each tromino = 3 squares

\[
\text{Number of trominoes} = (4^n - 1) / 3
\]

---

## 🎥 Note on Visualization

The example shown is **4×4 for simplicity**.

The same idea works for:
- 8×8  
- 16×16  
- 32×32  

---

## 🧠 Key Insight

> We don't solve the big board directly.  
> We reduce it into smaller identical problems.

---

## 🚀 Concepts Used

- Recursion  
- Divide and Conquer  
- Induction

Memory Rule (use this instead of full steps)

Whenever you see Tromino Tiling, just remember:

✅ 1. Divide

👉 Split into 4 equal parts

✅ 2. Center

👉 Place ONE tromino at center

✅ 3. Repeat

👉 Each part now has 1 missing → solve again
🧠 🎯 Induction Proof = 3 Fixed Blocks

Whenever you forget, just remember:

Base → Assume → Build

✅ 1. Base Case (always same)

Say:

👉 “For 
𝑛
=
1
n=1, board is 2×2 with one missing”
👉 “One tromino fills it”

✔️ Done.

✅ 2. Induction Hypothesis (just one line)

Say:

👉 “Assume it works for 
2
𝑘
×
2
𝑘
2
k
×2
k
”

✔️ Don’t overthink.

🔥 3. Induction Step (THIS is your Step 3 confusion)

Just remember this structure:

👉 Say this line:

“For 
2
𝑘
+
1
×
2
𝑘
+
1
2
k+1
×2
k+1
, divide into 4 quadrants”

👉 Then THIS (core idea):

“Place one center tromino to create 3 missing squares”

👉 Then finish:

“Now each quadrant has 1 missing → apply hypothesis”

🎯 That’s the entire proof

You don’t need more.

🧠 Ultra-Short Version (use this in exam/interview)

Base: 2×2 works
Assume: works for 
2
𝑘
2
k

Step: divide 
2
𝑘
+
1
2
k+1
, place center tromino, reduce to 4 smaller problems
Hence proved
🧠 Truth Tables — ONLY IMPORTANT CASES

Forget full tables. Remember these 5 patterns only.

🔥 1️⃣ AND ( ∧ ) → “ALL TRUE”

👉 Output is TRUE only if everything is TRUE

Important cases:
T ∧ T = T
T ∧ F = F
F ∧ anything = F
🧠 Memory line

“One false kills everything”

🔥 2️⃣ OR ( ∨ ) → “AT LEAST ONE TRUE”

👉 Output is TRUE if any one is TRUE

Important cases:
F ∨ F = F
T ∨ anything = T
🧠 Memory line

“One true saves everything”

🔥 3️⃣ NOT ( ¬ ) → “OPPOSITE”

👉 Just flip

¬T = F
¬F = T
🧠 Memory line

“Reverse”

🔥 4️⃣ IMPLICATION ( → ) → MOST IMPORTANT CONFUSION

👉 A → B means:

“If A then B”

Only ONE false case:
T → F = ❌ FALSE

All others are TRUE:

T → T = T
F → T = T
F → F = T
🧠 Memory line (VERY IMPORTANT)

“Only when promise is broken → false”

🔥 5️⃣ EQUIVALENCE ( ↔ )

👉 Same value → TRUE
👉 Different → FALSE

T ↔ T = T
F ↔ F = T
T ↔ F = F
🧠 Memory line

“Same = true, different = false”

🚀 MOST IMPORTANT SHORTCUTS (Use in CS)
✅ 1. Short-circuit thinking

Instead of full table:

AND → check for false first
OR → check for true first
✅ 2. Code understanding
if (A and B):

👉 Both must be true

if (A or B):

👉 At least one true

✅ 3. Common mistake (avoid)

People confuse:

👉 F → T (they think false)

❌ Wrong
✔️ It is TRUE

🧠 FINAL SUPER SHORT REVISION

👉 AND → all true
👉 OR → any true
👉 NOT → flip
👉 → → only T→F is false
👉 ↔ → same values

🔥 Why this is enough

You don’t need full tables because:

👉 In CS, you rarely write full tables
👉 You think using patterns

Why important in CS
🔹 1. Digital Circuits
AND, OR, NOT gates
Used in CPU design, hardware logic
🔹 2. Programming Conditions
if (A and B):

👉 Compiler internally follows truth logic

🔹 3. Testing / Debugging
Check all cases
Avoid logical bugs
🔹 4. Database Queries (SQL)
WHERE A AND B OR C

👉 Uses truth evaluation

🧠 One-line memory

“Truth tables = checking all possibilities of logic”

🧠 2️⃣ Proof by Contradiction
✅ Idea

To prove something is true:

👉 Assume it is false
👉 Show this leads to impossible situation
👉 So original statement is true

🎯 Simple example

Claim: √2 is irrational

Assume: √2 is rational
Leads to contradiction
So assumption wrong
🎯 Applications in CS
🔹 1. Algorithm correctness
Show wrong assumption breaks logic
🔹 2. Complexity proofs
Example: “No faster algorithm exists”
🔹 3. Graph theory
Proofs about connectivity, cycles
🔹 4. Compiler logic / Formal verification
Proving program properties
🧠 One-line memory

“Assume false → reach impossible → done”

🧠 3️⃣ Tromino Tiling (Your topic)
✅ Core Idea

🎯 Core Logic

Divide → place center → repeat

🎯 Applications in CS
🔹 1. Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Same pattern as:
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
🔹 2. Recursion Thinking
Breaking big problem into smaller ones
🔹 3. Matrix / Grid Problems
Used in:
image processing
game boards
🔹 4. Memory Allocation (conceptual)
Splitting memory blocks recursively
🔹 5. Parallel Computing
Divide work into equal parts
🧠 One-line memory

“Create equal subproblems using center tromino”

🔥 FINAL REVISION (SUPER SHORT)
🧩 Truth Table

👉 Check all logical possibilities
👉 Used in circuits, code, SQL

🧩 Contradiction

👉 Assume false → get impossible
👉 Used in proofs, algorithms

🧩 Tromino

👉 Divide → center → recurse
👉 Used in recursion & problem design

🚀 What you should do now (important)

Don’t just read.

👉 Say this out loud once:

“Truth table checks all cases”
“Contradiction assumes false”
“Tromino divides and balances”

👉 That locks memory.

Characteristics of a Good Proof

A good proof should be:

Correct → logically valid, no false steps
Complete → no missing steps or gaps
Clear → easy to understand
Well-organized → follows a proper structure
Elegant → simple and insightful (not unnecessarily complex)
Brief (but sufficient) → not too long, but not skipping logic

💡 A good proof is like a well-written program—structured, logical, and readable.

🧩 Structure of a Logical Argument

Typical flow:

Start with given assumptions
Apply logical steps
Use implications (→) carefully
Move step-by-step toward conclusion
End with final statement (what you wanted to prove)
🎯 Key Idea
Logic should always flow downward step-by-step
Avoid jumping randomly between steps
Each line should follow clearly from the previous one
🧠 Insight

A well-written proof shows not just correctness, but clarity of thinking.

⚠️ Note on Abstraction

The concept of abstraction was developed in computer science (e.g., work at MIT by pioneers like John Guttag and Barbara Liskov).

Abstraction helps us:
manage complexity
focus on important ideas
ignore unnecessary details

🧩 Sliding Puzzle, Lemmas & Invariant Theorem
📌 Problem Setup
Initial State
A   B   C
D   E   F
H   G   _
Final State
A   B   C
D   E   F
G   H   _

👉 Only difference: H and G are swapped

🎯 Goal

Determine whether the final configuration is reachable from the initial configuration using legal moves.

⚙️ Legal Moves
A tile can slide into the empty space _
Only adjacent (up, down, left, right) moves are allowed
🔹 Lemma 1: Row Moves Preserve Order
Before Row Move
A   B   C
D   E   F
H   G   _
After Row Move
A   B   C
D   E   F
H   _   G
🔍 Observation
Tiles shift horizontally
No tile crosses another

👉 Order of H and G remains the same

✅ Conclusion (Lemma 1)

Row moves do NOT change the relative order of elements

🔸 Lemma 2: Column Moves Change Order
Before Column Move
A   B   C
D   E   F
H   G   _
Step 1: Move F down
A   B   C
D   E   _
H   G   F
Step 2: Move C down
A   B   _
D   E   C
H   G   F
🔍 Observation

Focus on C and F:

Before:

C
F

After movement:

C moves downward
It crosses other tiles

👉 Relative order changes

✅ Conclusion (Lemma 2)

Column moves change the relative order of elements (due to crossing)

🧠 Key Concept: Invariant
❓ What is an Invariant?

An invariant is a property that:

remains unchanged (or follows a fixed rule) during all allowed moves

📌 Invariant in This Puzzle

👉 The invariant is:

Parity (even/odd nature) of the relative order of elements

Simplified meaning:
The arrangement of tiles has a hidden structure
Moves can only change it in a restricted way
You cannot freely swap any two tiles
🔍 Why Invariant Matters
Row moves → do not change order
Column moves → change order, but in a controlled pattern

👉 So overall:

The system preserves a hidden constraint (invariant)

🧩 Applying the Invariant

We need:

H   G   →   G   H

👉 This is a direct swap (complete reversal)

🔍 Check using lemmas
Row moves → ❌ cannot change order
Column moves → ✅ change order but not arbitrarily

👉 The required swap violates the invariant

🚫 Final Theorem

Not all configurations of the sliding puzzle are reachable

❌ Conclusion for Given Puzzle

👉 The transformation:

H G → G H

is IMPOSSIBLE

🔥 Final Takeaway
Row moves → preserve order
Column moves → controlled change
Invariant → restricts all movements

👉 Therefore:

Some configurations cannot be reached

🧠 One-Line Insight

If a required transformation breaks the invariant → it is impossible

🧩 Sliding Puzzle Rule
Count wrong pairs (inversions)
Find even or odd

👉 Compare start vs final

Same → possible
Different → not possible
🧠 Meaning

We don’t check moves
We just compare types

🧩 Example
A B C D E F H G → 1 (odd)
A B C D E F G H → 0 (even)
→ NOT possible

## 🎯 Purpose of This Topic

👉 This topic is mainly to understand:

> **Invariant (what stays unchanged)**

---

## 🧠 What is an Invariant?

An **invariant** is:

> A property that **does not change** during allowed moves

In this puzzle:

👉 The invariant is the **parity (even/odd nature) of inversion count**

---

## 🔑 What is a “Wrong Pair”?

A **wrong pair** (called an **inversion**) is:

> When a larger element comes **before** a smaller element

Example:

* H before G → ❌ wrong pair (inversion)

---

## 🎯 Rule

1. Count **inversions (wrong pairs)**
2. Determine **even or odd**
3. Compare initial vs final

* Same type → ✔️ Possible
* Different type → ❌ Not Possible

---

## 🧩 Example 1 (Classic)

### Initial:

A B C D E F G H

### Final:

A B C D E F H G

### Count:

* H before G → 1

👉 Final = 1 (ODD)
👉 Initial = 0 (EVEN)

❌ Different → **NOT POSSIBLE**

---

## 🧩 Example 2 (Your Example)

### Initial:

A B C D E F G H

### Final:

A B C D H E F G

### Count:

* H before E → 1
* H before F → 2
* H before G → 3

👉 Total = 3 (ODD)
👉 Initial = 0 (EVEN)

❌ Different → **NOT POSSIBLE**
